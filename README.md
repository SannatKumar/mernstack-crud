The project starts with command

$ npx create-react-app mernstack-myapp    "mernstack-myapp" is the folder and application name.


After the app has been created the unnecessary files such as report vitals, logo and icons were deleted and their definition and requirement was also removed from the importing files.

Install react bootstrap.

And import the bootstrap file in the src/app.js.

The Components folder is created with three components each for the task of creating, editing and listing the student records.
